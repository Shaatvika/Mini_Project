# Job Coach
Job Coach is an application that integrates Python and MySQL to provide users with a job that suits their skillset. A user-friendly GUI accepts input from users, namely Name, CGPA, Skillset and other job specifications, that will be compared with a set of predefined company requirements, stored in a SQL database.
A job that suits their skillset is allotted and displayed along with information about open positions, salary and contact details of the company, that are sourced from their respective databases.
